Following in the footsteps of his father, he ran for the Conservative Party in Beauce and became a Member of Parliament in 2006. He achieved the highest vote share for a Conservative outside of Alberta. As a prominent representative from Québec, he was immediately appointed Minister of Industry then became Minister of Foreign Affairs. However, he fell out of favour after a security scandal and was relegated to the back benches before returning to cabinet in a minor role as a Minister of State.</p><p>After the resignation of Stephen Harper from Conservative Party leadership, Bernier ran to be his successor on a platform of free markets and rugged individualism. Though he won the first preference ballot, he ultimately lost the contest on the final ballot. He eventually left the party to form the People's Party following a controversy over his criticisms of multiculturalism and diversity.</p>",
