Even worries of Liberal losses in the West don’t frighten St. Laurent’s party - if they lost every seat west of Ontario, they would still have a majority, so great is their dominance in the East. It seems that the best possible hope for the Tories is to hold the Liberals to a minority government, at least it seems that way to the party’s old guard, the Liberals themselves, and the media pundits. However, the party’s new leader, John Diefenbaker, has a vision of more for his party, if he can lead it to the promised land.",

Through four leaders and five elections the Tories have failed to break past 65 MPs and 35% of the popular vote. Relegated to a rump caucus of 50, based almost entirely out of English-speaking Ontario, the party finally thinks they might have a chance, if not for their leader. Twenty-one years of government has made the reigning Liberals complacent, with ministers like C.D Howe mismanaging issues like the Pipeline Debate and tariffs, pushing the people of Canada to look for a change - now it rests on the Tories to harness that feeling and finally break through. It does become a challenge, though, when they start off almost 20 points down in the polls.",

Though Canada’s economy is, for the most part, strong, there are those who say twenty-one years in government is too many, and the Pipeline Debate, the Suez Crisis, and a multitude of other issues could harm the party.
