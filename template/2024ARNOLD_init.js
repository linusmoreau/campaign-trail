Coming out of a global pandemic, there has been high inflation, two wars, and an increasingly divided Republican Party. While Schwarzenegger has remained popular through it all, most are ready for a change. Incumbent Vice President Lindsey Graham faces off against former Democratic Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky and Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla and SpaceX. Is the country finally ready to put the Democrats back in the Oval Office? Or can Graham ride the popularity of Schwarzenegger to offset his own unpopularity and the third election in a row with a strong third-party campaign?</p>",

Wade</i> doesn't get overturned in 2022, COVID gives Arnie a rally-around-the-flag effect like George W. Bush after 9/11, and the electoral geography is more akin to 2012. As you can see down below, you see that Iowa, Ohio, and Florida are still battlegrounds, the rust belt trio that Trump won is reliably Democratic, and Arizona and Texas are redder states (having McSally could explain Arizona though). The other factor is that Elon Musk is taking a lot of Republican and even Democratic votes in many different places across the country. You can find all of the election changes from our timeline by clicking on the link above. <p>In terms of Roe not being overturned, this is due to Arnie appointing more wholesome judges that don't overturn it, unlike Trump picking Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Barrett. To be honest, I'm not exactly sure who Arnie appoints and it is irrelevant for these mods. When it comes to COVID, it's just clear that anyone but Trump would've listened to the experts and the only reason the GOP was so anti-lockdown and anti-Fauci in our timeline was because of President Trump setting the example to ignore them whereas Schwarzenegger would listen.</p><h4>Canon Map</h4><p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cEUWbfz.png\" width=\"600px\"><br><br></p><h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4><p>Q: Why are Musk, Trump, and Huckabee eligible for the debates when they need to get 15% of the vote to qualify?<p>A: I actually caught this during playtesting of this mod, and I knew that nothing could be done to change that at this point. Therefore, the in-universe explanation is that the Huckabee campaign in 2016 would file a lawsuit or something that would change this rule to make it 10%, and they would get their way. Musk would be over 10% in a lot of polls before going down as a result of the Springfield controversies and MSG rally. <p>Q: Why all the MAGA references in this mod?<p>A: If you think about it, MAGA would still exist in this universe, albeit it would be a lot smaller than it is in our timeline. January 6th would still happen because Donald Trump would always be in denial of the 2016 and 2020 elections in this timeline, and he would want his supporters to come and protest the certification of 2020 considering he was on the ballot and didn't win any state. Trump would be disqualified from the race because he would still have his indictments over January 6th and the Stormy Daniels affair. The judges would follow the constitution and use the Insurrection Clause against Donald Trump and remove him from the race, forcing Trump to drop out and endorse Elon Musk. In terms of MSG, Trump would still want to campaign with Musk in New York City to help build his popular vote totals, and that would all go how we know it.<p>Q: Why would Donald Trump endorse Elon Musk of all people?<p>A: To be honest with you, I felt that it was appropriate to hve a candidate that would only have been eligible through the Arnold Amendment, because that is the whole premises of this mod series. I felt that since Elon has that outsider populist rhetoric, it would be fitting for Trump to endorse him to appeal to all political spectrums. In terms of the Musk campaign, I would say that 80% of his support came from Graham and 20% from Beshear. It's probably self-explanatory though, because Graham would've gotten the MAGA crowd and Beshear would've gotten the tech-bros and maybe some blue-collar voters too.</p><h4>Message from Modder</h4><p>If you would've told me after releasing my original 2016: Arnold Amendment mod that this series would come to this, I would've called you crazy. But here we are. This is my only mod series, and I'm really happy with the way it turned out. Arnold Schwarzenegger is very intriguing and it's cool to see what happens if the Arnold Amendment passes allowing naturalized citizens to run for President and if he switches places with Donald Trump. I think the country would be a lot different and a much happier place had we lived in this timeline. </p><p>I do want to thank you all for playing through this mod series. I want to give a shoutout to the creators of the TFC series and the Red series for inspiring me to do a third installment of the Arnold Amendment series (but mostly the TFC creators). Now I know I've mentioned that it is unclear as to where my modding career goes from here. But I've decided that I am going to be reduxing some of my older mods including 1992MLK and a few others that I will reveal at a later time. It is getting more and more difficult to come up with mod ideas as I've used up all of them, other modders have beat me to them, and especially my real-life responsibilities including school and other things. But thank you for sticking with me, and I hope you have enjoyed 2024: Arnold Amendment. What are you waiting for? Go play it again! </p><p>-Environmental_Cap104</p> <br><br>",

The son of former Democratic Kentucky Governor Steve Beshear, he is an interesting figure, and a popular one. Defeating the unpopular incumbent Governor Matt Bevin in deep-red Kentucky in 2019, he has had widespread popularity there. He is a foil to President Arnold Schwarzenegger in some ways, in that he is a centrist for his party and is a Democratic governor from a red state. Kentucky is unlikely to vote blue, but his moderate positions can be crucial to win the Midwest and Southeast, where third-parties have played spoiler in the era of Arnold Schwarzenegger. However, discontent with the war in Gaza has triggered a third-party campaign from Jill Stein, which could hurt among progressives.</p>",

Elon Musk is expected to continue Donald Trump's Make America Great Again movement after being a strong supporter of him since his third-party candidacy in 2020. While he's not expected to win the election by any means, he can do a lot of damage to Graham's campaign like Trump and Huckabee attempted to do the last two times.

Born as an American citizen in Bangkok, Thailand, she joined the Army as a helicopter pilot. She lost both legs below the knee when her helicopter was hit by a grenade during the Iraq War in 2004. She would later enter Congress representing suburban Chicago, and later defeated incumbent Senator Mark Kirk in Illinois in 2016. Tammy Duckworth has became an advocate for veterans, immigration reform, and women's rights in the House and Senate. Her backstory can really appeal to many demographics and groups of people, especially in her home region of the Midwest and Illinois. Duckworth would also be the first female Vice President of the United States, as well as the first Asian to serve as Vice President.</p>",
